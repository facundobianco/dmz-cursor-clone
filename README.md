# Vanilla-DMZ cursor

### Why this repo

This repository is a clone from [openSUSE's art repo](https://gitorious.org/opensuse/art)
at gitorious.org. As it is publicly known, gitorious.org was acquired 
by GitLab and gitorious.org [will shut down at the end of May 2015](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/).

I don't know what openSUSE will do about his art repo, so I cloned the
subdirectory *cursors* that has Vainilla-DMZ cursors (both version,
white and black).

### The autor

Vanilla-DMZ cursors were designed by [Jakub Steiner](http://jimmac.musichall.cz).

### For porting this repo

Download only the icon theme from the branch [cursors](https://github.com/vando/dmz-cursor-clone/tree/cursors).
